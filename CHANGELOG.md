## 0.9.2

* New Field Mapping screen: you can now map any magento field to any reverb api field. Get a list of reverb api fields from https://reverb.com/swagger

## 0.9.1
* Reach back a day (instead of 11 minutes) for order updates. This compensates for broken or slow crons that may miss some orders. This behavior is often due to other plugins on your system slowing down cron functions.

## 0.9.0
* Base image is now sent as the primary image to Reverb if there is one set
* New syncable fields: shipping_profile_name, finish, year.  Please create your own attributes in magento for these and map them in the settings screen if you want them.
* Description syncs on update - control whether it syncs in the settings screen.

* Order pagination fix - if you have more than 24 orders per syncing period, we will now find them

* Make and model are synced on both create and update
* Make and model mapping can now successfully map to dropdowns and send the value of the dropdown

## 0.7.0
* Fix issues with Magento Enterprise Edition related to curl library incompatibility

## 0.6.3
* Fixes incorrect ordering of category mappings resulting in categories not syncing to Reverb. Note that this release will wipe out your category mappings, and you'll have to reassign the mappings. Since they weren't working correctly to begin with, this should not be an issue.

## 0.6.2

## 0.4.6
* Set up category mappings to create products
* Ability to select default store for order creation for multi-store setups

## 0.4.5
* Orders are now created in the default store instead of the admin store. The end result is that order numbering should be consistent with existing orders instead of starting from 0001.

## 0.4.4
* Magento owner can select whether to sync accepted offers (unpaid orders) or only paid orders
